This article will help you set up and configure Connections, Views, Modules and Magic Actions as well inviting your team members. Set up should only take about 15 minutes for connections and maximum 1 hour for automations. You might need a developer to help with set up. This is the only stage where they might need to be involved. 

For more in-depth walkthroughs, check out our Guides \[INSERT LINK] section.

## Starting out

Think about which Connections you need and what automations you’d like to prioritize.

## Step 1: Connections

### Adding connections

**Database**\
You will need an API key to connect to your database(s).

**Chargify**\
You will need an API key to connect to your Chargify account.

**All other integrations**\
Make sure you have account and login details for the connection you want to add. All you have to do is click the “Connect” button. If you don't have login details to the 3rd party service, you might have to ask whoever is the admin it to help.

### Invite your developer
On the left side navigation bar, go to Team Settings > Members. Then click "Invite New Member". You should see their name and email pop up in the Invites section.

## Step 2: Views

### Adding Views
On the left side navigation bar, head over to "All Views". Click the "Add View" button in top right corner.

A modal will pop up:
[INSERT ADD VIEW POP UP HERE]

Just enter the name for the View (ex. Customers, Payments, Partners, Users, etc.) and select the data source from the Connections you've already added.

Repeat this step as needed for each view you want to see.

### Editing and Deleting Views

On the left side navigation bar, head over to "All Views". Find the View you want to edit or delete and click the "..." to access the drop down menu.

### Configuring Views
From "All Views", click into the selected View from the list. Once you're in the View you want to configure, click "Configure" button in the top right corner.  

A modal will pop up:

\[INSERT MODAL]

You can add new fields, reorder them by dragging the tags and delete the fields by clicking the "x".

You can add searchable fields by entering them in "Search Fields" to make it easier to navigate to the right item in the view.

## Step 3: Modules

In order to add or modify a Module, you have to be in "Configure" mode. Navigate to an item that you want to add more detail to (for example, a Customer page) then click the "Configure" button in the top right corner. Once the Configure button switches to green, you are in "Configure" mode, which allows you to modify Modules and Actions.

## Step 4: Magic actions

**Adding actions**\
For 3rd party services that you have account details for, you can configure it all yourself using our easy step-by-step Builder. If your actions involve your database or internal API, you will need to get help from your developer team. This could include actions like extending a trial. The developer would create an API endpoint and hook it up to an action that triggers it. It can be as simple or as complex as you want it to be.
