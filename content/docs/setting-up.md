Set up should only take about 15 minutes for connections and maximum 1 hour for automations. You might need a developer to help with set up. This is the only stage where they might need to be involved. Think about which connections you need and what automations you’d like to prioritize to start out. 

Connections

Adding connections

You will need an API key for 2 of our integrations: your own database and Chargify. All of our other supported integrations use OAuth. This means if you have the login for the connection you want to add, all you have to do is click a “connect” button.
