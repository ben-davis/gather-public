This article will help you set up Connections and Magic Actions, inviting your team members and configurations. Set up should only take about 15 minutes for connections and maximum 1 hour for automations. You might need a developer to help with set up. This is the only stage where they might need to be involved. 

For more in-depth walkthroughs, check out our Guides \[INSERT LINK] section.

## Starting out

Think about which Connections you need and what automations you’d like to prioritize.

## **Connections**

**Adding connections**

**Database**\
You will need an API key to connect to your database(s).

**Chargify**\
You will need an API key to connect to your Chargify account.

**All other integrations**\
Make sure you have account and login details for the connection you want to add. All you have to do is click the “Connect” button. If you don't have login details to the 3rd party service, you might have to ask whoever is the admin it to help.

**Invite your developer**\
On the left side navigation bar, go to Team Settings > Members. Then click "Invite New Member". You should see their name and email pop up in the Invites section.

## **Magic actions**

**Adding actions**\
For 3rd party services that you have account details for, you can configure it all yourself using our easy step-by-step Builder. If your actions involve your database or internal API, you will need to get help from your developer team. This could include actions like extending a trial. The developer would create an API endpoint and hook it up to an action that triggers it. It can be as simple or as complex as you want it to be.
