## Connections

In order for Gather to pull data from a third-party source or to perform an operation in another app, you need to add a Connection. Connections in Gather have two main functions: providing data to Views and Modules and providing operations that can be used in Magic Actions. For example, the database Connection can be used to create Views that show all your customers or their order data. And the Stripe Connection provides operations like creating refunds that can be used as steps in Magic Actions. All credentials are securely encrypted.

## Magic Actions

Step-by-step automations created in Builder. Create a single button to handle repetitive internal processes for customer requests like refunding payments and resetting passwords.

## Views

Views are windows into data. For example, a customer View will allow you to list all of your customers, filter them by location, search them by name, or view all the data for an individual customer.

You could then add a view for your orders and Gather will intelligently link your customer View with your order View, allowing your to seamlessly navigate through your most important data.

Views can also be added for third-party connections like Stripe. For example with a couple clicks, you can create a view that shows you all Stripe payments that have been made - with the ability to filter and search to find the payment you need,  automatically linked with the right customer using Gatherâ€™s intelligent linking functionality.

Views are the powerhouse of Gather. No matter how your data is structured, views can be created and configured to display the information you need.

## Modules

When looking at an individual entity within a View (like an individual customer), you often want to see associated information about that entity. For example, when looking at an individual customer you probably need to see their Stripe account information or their latest order in Shopify. Modules are where that associated data get displayed. Modules can display any data supported by a Connection in Gather, from Stripe payments, to Chargify subscriptions, to Shopify orders.
