## Connections

Connections are integrations. Adding a Connection to a 3rd party tool like Stripe, Chargify or Salesforce allows you to set up Views or Modules within Gather. You can also push data across to perform Magic Actions (like giving a refund via Stripe).

## Magic Actions

Step by step automations created in Builder. Create a single button to handle repetitive internal processes for customer requests like refunding payments and resetting passwords.

## Views

Views are windows into data. For example, a customer View will allow you to list all of your customers, filter them by location, search them by name, or view all the data for an individual customer.

## Modules

When looking at an individual entity within a view (like an individual customer), you often want to see associated information about that entity. For example, when looking at an individual customer you probably need to see their Stripe account information or their latest order in Shopify. Modules are how you pull in that associated data.
