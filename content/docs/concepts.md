## Connections

In order for Gather pull data from a third-party source or to perform an operation in another app, you need to add a connection. Connections in Gather have two main functions: providing data to views and modules and providing operations that can be used in Magic Actions. For example, the database connection can be used to create views that show all your customers or their order data. And the Stripe connection provides operations like creating refunds that can be used as steps in Magic Actions. All credentials are securely encrypted.

## Magic Actions

Step by step automations created in Builder. Create a single button to handle repetitive internal processes for customer requests like refunding payments and resetting passwords.

## Views

Views are windows into data. For example, a customer View will allow you to list all of your customers, filter them by location, search them by name, or view all the data for an individual customer.

## Modules

When looking at an individual entity within a view (like an individual customer), you often want to see associated information about that entity. For example, when looking at an individual customer you probably need to see their Stripe account information or their latest order in Shopify. Modules are how you pull in that associated data.
