## What is Gather?

Gather is a powerful, customizable admin tool for customer support teams. Gather aggregates customer data, like charges from Stripe or order info from Shopify, and automates repetitive backend processes, like issuing refunds via Chargify or changing account information in your database. Gather is so easy to configure, any non-technical manager can build custom automations and data views in minutes to supercharge their team’s productivity.

## Why use Gather?

Gather unblocks customer support teams by empowering them to build the internal tools they need right now, instead of waiting for developer resources. For developers, Gather removes the burden of managing an entirely separate internal tool and building all of the process-based integrations, allowing them to get back to work on the product.

## Do developers need to be involved?

Only for set up - which should take 15 minutes for connections and maximum 1 hour for automations.

**Setting up connections:**\
You will need an API key for 2 of our integrations: your own database and Chargify. All of our other supported integrations use OAuth. This means if you have the login for the connection you want to add, all you have to do is click a “connect” button.



## Is it secure?

Yes. We treat security very seriously. We store your API keys encrypted. We don't don't store data, only metadata. We encrypt all data in transit.
