## What is Gather

Gather is a powerful, customizable admin tool for customer support teams that aggregates customer data, like charges from Stripe or order info from Shopify, and automates repetitive backend processes, like issuing refunds via Chargify or changing account information in your database. Gather is so easy to configure, any non-technical manager can build custom automations and data views in minutes to supercharge their team’s productivity.

## Why use Gather?

Gather unblocks customer support teams by empowering them with tools designed to be easy to use to build the internal tools they need right now, instead of waiting for developer resources. For developers, Gather removes the burden of managing an entirely separate internal tool and building all of the process-based integrations, allowing them to get back to work on the product.

## Do developers need to be involved?

Gather is designed to remove the burden of building internal tools, so naturally developers aren’t required to do much. Usually a developer will add the database connection and any other connections that only they have access too (Stripe, for instance). That’s enough to allow the customer support team to build all of the views that aggregate the data in the way they need. The CS team can also build many of the actions to automate manual processes, like refunds via Stripe, without involvement from the dev team. Sometimes though, the CS team will want to automate a process that needs to communicate with your API, in which case the dev might set up that action in Gather.

## Is it secure?
